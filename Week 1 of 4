- I actually started with the Reverse Engineering.. But no matter how many times I saw the videos, I couldn't understand anything.. I will see more videos on youtube and try to understand it by next week..
- Then I started doing "Gojo's Reversal Cursed Technique" .. I have reallyy almost spent 2-3 hours everyday on this task.. I am having some progress on it everyday.. I have now made some good progress..
